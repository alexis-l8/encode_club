This is a simple Solidity smart contract called `HelloWorld`. Let's break it down line by line:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
```

This is a comment that indicates the license under which the code is released. SPDX is a standardized way of communicating license information.

```
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
```

This line specifies the version of Solidity being used. In this case, the contract is written in a version of Solidity that is greater than or equal to version 0.7.0 but less than version 0.9.0.

```
contract HelloWorld {
```

This is the start of the contract declaration. The contract is called `HelloWorld`.

```
string private text;
```

This line declares a private string variable called `text`. Private variables can only be accessed from within the contract.

```
address public owner;
```

This line declares a public address variable called `owner`. Public variables can be accessed from outside the contract.

```
constructor() {
    text = "Hello World";
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

This is the constructor function, which is executed only once when the contract is deployed. It sets the initial value of `text` to "Hello World" and sets the `owner` to the address of the account that deployed the contract.

```
function getText() public view returns (string memory) {
    return text;
}
```

This function is a public view function called `getText()` which returns the value of `text`.

```
function setText(string calldata newText) public onlyOwner {
    text = newText;
}
```

This function is a public function called `setText()`. It sets the value of `text` to the `newText` input parameter, but only if the sender of the transaction is the `owner` of the contract. This is enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which we'll see defined later.

```
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    owner = newOwner;
}
```

This function is a public function called `transferOwnership()`. It sets the `owner` of the contract to the `newOwner` input parameter, but only if the sender of the transaction is the `owner` of the contract. This is also enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

```
modifier onlyOwner()
{
    require (msg.sender == owner, "Called is not the owner");
    _;
}
```

This is a modifier called `onlyOwner`. A modifier is a function that can modify the behavior of other functions in the contract. In this case, the `onlyOwner` modifier checks that the sender of the transaction is the `owner` of the contract, and if not, it throws an error message. The `_` symbol is a placeholder that indicates where the modified function should be executed.
